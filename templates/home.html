    <title>ZeroAgent - Create AI Agent for your Store</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to ZeroAgent!</h1>
    <p>ZeroAgent is a platform that connects to your Shopify or Wix store and adds an AI agent to your store website as a chat widget. These agents interact with customers, offer product suggestions, answer queries and provide assistance, just like a salesperson in a physical store.</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>ZeroAgent connects to Shopify or Wix stores and instantly adds an AI-powered chat widget. All the store products are added to the AI’s knowledge base automatically. Agents recommend products, answer questions, place orders, and help shoppers interact with the store. Agents can also forward Shoppers' queries directly to the store owner. Store owners can see all customer conversations and insights. Additionally, the ‘Talk with Zero’ feature helps store owners manage operations like inventory and orders.</p>
